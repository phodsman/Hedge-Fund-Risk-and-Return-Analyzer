# Hedge-Fund-Risk-and-Return-Analyzer
This program uses Jupyter Lab visualizations to display performance history of four of the biggest hedge funds using various metrics such as daily performance, volatility, risk, Sharpe ratios (for risk compared to return), and beta measurements (comparison of price changes to the overall market). Rolling windows of several of these metrics are used.
